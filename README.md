# Color_detection
This project blends advanced technologies and essential libraries. It efficiently leverages OpenCV for image processing and K-Means clustering from scikit-learn to identify and group prominent colors in input images. Matplotlib facilitates a user-friendly display of the color palette. Key technologies and libraries include OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The project's functions execute K-Means clustering and create an appealing color scale, making it a valuable tool for designers and artists seeking an intuitive means of analyzing and understanding color palettes.
